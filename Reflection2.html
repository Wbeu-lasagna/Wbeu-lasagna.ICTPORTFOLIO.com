<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p> This quarter was mainly focused on CSS. CSS is mainly used to style a webpage. It helps make a website look more clean and saves a lot of work. This quarter I learned how to utilize CSS and apply it to my website. Because of CSS I was able to decorate my website in any way I wanted. At first it was kind of hard for me to use CSS because I couldn't get it to work properly, but after a while I was able to solve my problem with some minor changes and fixes in my code. With CSS I was able to put elements in specific places or change the size of texts. I was more satisfied with my portfolio now then the one from the 1st Quarter because CSS made it easier for me to design the webpage how I wanted. This quarter helped me realize how much easier it is to make a website with CSS and how much time I was able to save by utilizing all of its properties. I'm very happy that I was able to learn about CSS and now I am also excited to learn JavaScript. </p>
